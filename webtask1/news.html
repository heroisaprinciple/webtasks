        <p>Federer is married to former Women's Tennis Association player Miroslava Federer (n√©e Vavrinec), whom he met while they were both competing for Switzerland at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Usually called Mirka, she retired from the tour in 2002 because of a foot injury.
            They were married at Wenkenhof Villa in Riehen near Basel on 11 April 2009, surrounded by a small group of close friends and family. In 2009, she gave birth to identical twin girls.
            They had another pair of twins in 2014, this time fraternal twin boys. Their children were baptized in the Catholic
            faith by Federer's distant cousin Monsignor Urban Federer, who is the Abbot of Einsiedeln Abbey.</p>
